# Subjective-Objective-Sentence-Classification
This repository contains code classification of a sentence as either objective/subjective using CNN and MLP, also I have created a Gradio Application for this, thus we can use this with a front end Interface as well.

How to execute this:

1. First download the dataset and upload into the colab.
2. Execute the MLP notebook cell by cell and download the baseline.pt file that will be downloaded.
3. Execute the CNN notebook cell by cell and download the cnn.pt file that will be downloaded.
4. Upload baseline.pt and cnn.pt file and execute the gradio notebook.
5. Now you can check for different sentences.

Sample Results:
